# DigitalMe

DigitalMe is a set of applications to collect your editing informations.
It collects your coding informations like filetype, coding speed, coding 
patterns. 

It can answer your questions like the followings:

- How often do you code?
- How fast do you code?
- When do you code often?
- What languages do you usually deal with?

Data collected would be processed and visualized properly through a web
 interface.

It's dynamic. When you type, the web interface would react
correspondingly with the behaviour that you can personalize.

Ultimately, it's a digilization of yourself.
