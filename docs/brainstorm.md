## What do I want achieve with this project?

Gather some fun/boring statistic about my daily coding process, including
but not limited to:

* total hours spent on programming
* languages decompositions
* coding speeds
* coding projects
* how many 'if' has been typed

Then I want to visualize these data with charts and creative coding
arts.

Also, I want to automatically track the technologies I used daily. To
find out technologies that:

* I'm totally fluent with
* I'm partially fluent with
* I'm interested sometimes ago and should be picked up again soon
* I should know about but doesn't really have time to dig in
* I really need to invest time into, like participate in NodeJS dev

I want to show the list above to the public so that people would have
the base knowledge about me and hopefully gives them a better start to
contact me. For example, on the website, if say I had a tech that hasn't
been using for a while, people then can ping me to remind me to refresh
the knowledge. Or I can just send myself an email automatically. why
not.

Apart from all of that, I want to use this project as a resume, where
real data tells the story instead of subjectively introducing myself by
myself.

The site should be composed by components that can be integrated to
other site really easily. Or rather, the project should be regarded as
primarily a backend project where datas can be pulled by using
corresponding library methods.
